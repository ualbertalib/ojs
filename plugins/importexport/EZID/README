For first time user, configure the plugin under "Settings." Two required configurations are setup through Journal's setup page: Journal publisher and Journal online ISSN.
To export metadata in CrossRef XML format only, username/password fields are optional. If registration and DOI assignment with EZID is needed, username/password fields need to be filled out. DOI settings will be drawn from the DOI PubId Plugin, unless the shoulder setting is provided. If the shoulder setting is filled out, new DOIs will be minted based on this shoulder.

From there, individual article can be assigned DOI as well as exported in CrossRef xml file by clicking on the "REGISTER" or "EXPORT" link on the same row of each article. Towards the bottom of the page, selected articles can be batch registered by clicking on the button "Register". All the articles on the page can be selected at once by clicking on the "Select All" button.

"All Articles" link will direct you to the page listing all the articles of this journal, including registered and not registered articles. From there, for individual article, if it has not registered with EZID before, it can be assigned DOI by clicking on the "REGISTER"; if it has DOI already, then the link will be shown as "EDIT" and its DOI can be reassigned with updated metadata being recorded. By clicking on the "EXPORT" link, the metadata for the article can be exported in CrossRef xml file. Towards the bottom of the page, selected articles can be batch registered by clicking on the button "Register". All the articles on the page can be selected at once by clicking on the "Select All" button. For each article, if it has DOI assigned, the STATUS column will show the DOI as a link which can redirect to the actual EZID DOI link with all the metadata populated.

"All Issues" link will direct you to the page listing all the issues of this journal. You can perform similar actions on all the issues as to the page for all the articles described above.
